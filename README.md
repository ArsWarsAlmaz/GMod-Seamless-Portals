# GMod-Seamless-Portals
My seamless portals addon for garrys mod

To install this addon, download and unzip the contents and put it in your garrys mod addon folder

BEST RESULTS ARE IN A LOCAL SERVER BECAUSE I CANT DO PREDICTION IN SINGLEPLAYER!

This WILL become an addon on the workshop ONCE IT IS FINISHED!


I plan to add:
```
-hopefully a fix for the black clipping plane
-scaling portals that resize players and props
-better prop clipping & collision through portals
```
